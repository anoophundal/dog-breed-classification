# Dog Breed Classification

This project implements a convolutional neural network (CNN) for classifying dog breeds
using the Stanford Dogs dataset. The notebook covers data preprocessing, model training,
and evaluation of classification performance.

Technologies:
- Python
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
- Computer Vision
- Google Colab
- VS Code
- Jupyter Notebook

Note: This project is based on a publicly available Kaggle notebook and was adapted,
executed, and studied as part of an academic mini project to understand CNN-based
image classification workflows.
